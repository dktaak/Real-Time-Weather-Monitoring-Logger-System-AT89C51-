# Real-Time-Weather-Monitoring-Logger-System-AT89C51-
AIM: To collect and store various parameters like temperature, light intensity as data through different sensors and implement a logger system which converts this data into a meaningful format using 8051 Micro controller .  

Components used: Project is implemented in Proteus Simulator as well as on hardware.  

Devices and Sensors: 8051 Micro controller (AT89c52), RTC (DS1307), EEPROM(AT24C512), Temperature sensor (DS1621), ADC (MCP3204), LDR, Virtual Terminal (Serial Window), LCD (20*4), Potentiometer

Interfacing Summary: 
1) RTC interfacing using I2C 
2) EEPROM interfacing using I2C 
3) DS1621 Temperature sensor using I2C  
4) ADC MCP3204 using SPI (Potentiometer and LDR)  
5) Virtual Terminal â€“ UART  
6) LCD interfacing
