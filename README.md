# Real-Time-Weather-Monitoring-Logger-System-AT89C51-
AIM: To collect and store various parameters like temperature, light intensity as data through different sensors and implement a logger system which converts this data into a meaningful format using 8051 Micro controller .  Components used: Project is implemented in Proteus Simulator as well as on hardware.  Devices and Sensors: 8051 Micro controller (AT89c52), RTC (DS1307), EEPROM(AT24C512), Temperature sensor (DS1621), ADC (MCP3204), LDR, Virtual Terminal (Serial Window), LCD (20*4), Potentiometer  Interfacing Summary: 1) RTC interfacing using I2C  2) EEPROM interfacing using I2C  3) DS1621 Temperature sensor using I2C  4) ADC MCP3204 using SPI (Potentiometer and LDR)  5) Virtual Terminal â€“ UART  6) LCD interfacing  Project Review: - This project helped me to get hands on experience on Protocols(Uart, spi, i2c). - I got enough confidence on reading the data sheets of several peripheral and interfacing of them. - I enjoyed this project by adding Some extra features like adding the keypad(4x4) lock with some special symbols implementing in CGRAM of LCD, RFID lock, printing buzzer animation on over increase of temp     and then cooling the nearby air turning on of the motor until the temp come in range. -  I know project title is not much attractive , but i must say this has covered my most the concepts in     embedded. Also it was challenging to implement these protocols and interfacing eeprom (sequential     reading)   A small description on how we can modify this project: - We can add GSM module to make it more advance and can get the alert on phone in case of over heating of the device. - we can use socket programming to send the data of logger in the connected network.
